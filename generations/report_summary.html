	<h2>Summary of the paper</h2>
	<p>This paper presents a novel method, Stable Diffusion, which is a latent diffusion model (LDM) that reduces computational cost while preserving high generative performance. It is used to reconstruct images from human brain activity obtained via fMRI. The inner mechanisms of the LDM are studied and it is found to incorporate semantic information from the text-conditioning, while maintaining the appearance of the original image. An encoding model is used to interpret the internal operations of the LDM and results show that images reconstructed using zc produce higher accuracy values than those reconstructed using only z or c.
