	<h2>Summary of the paper</h2>
	<p>This paper presents a new method based on a latent diffusion model (LDM) to reconstruct high-resolution images from brain activity obtained via fMRI. The method reduces computational costs while preserving high generative performance and provides a quantitative interpretation of its components from a neuroscientific perspective. The proposed method can reconstruct images with high fidelity without any additional training or fine-tuning of complex deep-learning models. The study also mapped the LDM to brain activity in order to interpret its internal operations, and compared the accuracy of images reconstructed using only z, c, or zc. Results showed that images reconstructed using zc had both visual consistency and semantic fidelity, and that the prediction map of c was more similar to the prediction map of zc with a reduced noise level. Finally, the paper discussed research projects that use brain activity to reconstruct visual images, natural language processing, and other cognitive tasks.</p>
